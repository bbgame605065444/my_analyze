  # Root: Primary arrhythmia classification
  - node_id: arrhythmia_classification_root
    question: "Is an arrhythmia present and what is its fundamental mechanism?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Arrhythmia classification by mechanism:
      
      1. Normal Sinus Rhythm: Regular, 60-100 bpm, normal P-QRS-T sequence
      
      2. Bradyarrhythmias (<60 bpm):
         - Sinus bradycardia: Slow but normal conduction
         - AV blocks: Conduction delays/blocks between atria and ventricles
         - Escape rhythms: Backup pacemakers (junctional, ventricular)
      
      3. Tachyarrhythmias (>100 bpm):
         - Supraventricular: Origin above ventricles (narrow QRS usually)
         - Ventricular: Origin in ventricles (wide QRS usually)
         - Re-entrant vs automatic vs triggered mechanisms
      
      Initial assessment focuses on rate, regularity, QRS width, and P-wave relationship.
    context: "Mechanism-based classification guides specific treatment approaches"
    is_root: true
    clinical_significance: "Accurate arrhythmia classification determines appropriate emergency vs elective treatment"

  # Bradyarrhythmia branch
  - node_id: bradyarrhythmia_analysis
    question: "What is the specific type and severity of bradyarrhythmia?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Bradyarrhythmia classification:
      
      Sinus Node Disorders:
      - Sinus bradycardia: Rate 40-59 bpm, normal P-waves
      - Sinus arrest/pause: Absence of P-waves for >3 seconds
      - Sick sinus syndrome: Alternating brady-tachy, chronotropic incompetence
      
      AV Conduction Blocks:
      - 1st degree: PR >200ms, stable
      - 2nd degree Type I: Progressive PR lengthening (Wenckebach)
      - 2nd degree Type II: Fixed PR with sudden dropped beats
      - 2:1 AV block: Every other P-wave conducted
      - High-grade AV block: Multiple consecutive dropped beats
      - 3rd degree (complete): Complete AV dissociation
      
      Escape Rhythms:
      - Junctional: 40-60 bpm, narrow QRS, no P-waves or inverted P-waves
      - Ventricular: 20-40 bpm, wide QRS, AV dissociation
      
      Hemodynamic significance depends on symptoms and underlying heart disease.
    context: "Bradyarrhythmia severity determines need for temporary vs permanent pacing"
    parent: arrhythmia_classification_root
    clinical_significance: "Progressive AV blocks can cause sudden cardiac death requiring emergent pacing"

  # Supraventricular tachycardia branch
  - node_id: supraventricular_tachycardia_analysis
    question: "What is the specific mechanism and type of supraventricular tachycardia?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) Classification:
      
      Atrial Arrhythmias:
      - Atrial Fibrillation: Irregularly irregular, no discrete P-waves, fibrillatory waves
      - Atrial Flutter: Regular "sawtooth" flutter waves, usually 150 bpm (300 atrial rate with 2:1 block)
      - Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: Irregular, â‰¥3 different P-wave morphologies
      - Atrial Tachycardia: Regular, discrete P-waves different from sinus, 150-250 bpm
      
      AV Nodal Re-entrant Tachycardia (AVNRT):
      - Regular, 150-250 bpm, narrow QRS
      - P-waves often hidden in QRS or appear as pseudo-R' in V1
      - Sudden onset/termination
      
      AV Re-entrant Tachycardia (AVRT):
      - Uses accessory pathway (WPW syndrome)
      - Orthodromic: Narrow QRS, retrograde P-waves
      - Antidromic: Wide QRS (pre-excited)
      
      Response to vagal maneuvers and adenosine helps differentiate mechanisms.
    context: "SVT mechanism determines specific treatment approach and long-term management"
    parent: arrhythmia_classification_root
    clinical_significance: "Some SVTs can degenerate to life-threatening arrhythmias requiring urgent treatment"

  # Ventricular arrhythmia branch
  - node_id: ventricular_arrhythmia_analysis
    question: "What is the type and risk level of ventricular arrhythmia?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Ventricular Arrhythmia Classification:
      
      Premature Ventricular Complexes (PVCs):
      - Isolated: <10% of total beats, usually benign
      - Frequent: >10% of beats, may cause cardiomyopathy
      - Patterns: Bigeminy, trigeminy, multifocal, R-on-T phenomenon
      
      Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):
      - Sustained: >30 seconds or hemodynamically significant
      - Non-sustained: <30 seconds, often asymptomatic
      - Monomorphic: Consistent QRS morphology, suggests focal origin
      - Polymorphic: Varying QRS morphology, suggests multiple origins
      
      Torsades de Pointes:
      - Polymorphic VT with QT prolongation
      - "Twisting of points" appearance
      - Associated with medications, electrolyte abnormalities
      
      Ventricular Fibrillation (VF):
      - Chaotic, irregular waveforms
      - No organized QRS complexes
      - Immediately life-threatening, requires defibrillation
      
      Risk stratification based on structural heart disease, ejection fraction, and symptoms.
    context: "Ventricular arrhythmias carry highest risk of sudden cardiac death"
    parent: arrhythmia_classification_root
    clinical_significance: "VT/VF requires immediate defibrillation and anti-arrhythmic therapy"

  # Atrial fibrillation specific analysis
  - node_id: atrial_fibrillation_characterization
    question: "What are the specific characteristics and management implications of atrial fibrillation?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Characterization:
      
      ECG Features:
      - Irregularly irregular rhythm
      - Absence of discrete P-waves
      - Fibrillatory waves (best seen in V1)
      - Variable ventricular response rate
      
      Classification by Duration:
      - Paroxysmal: Self-terminating, <7 days
      - Persistent: Sustained >7 days, requires intervention
      - Long-standing persistent: >12 months
      - Permanent: Accepted, rate control only
      
      Rate Control Assessment:
      - Controlled: Resting HR 60-100 bpm
      - Rapid ventricular response: HR >100 bpm
      - Slow ventricular response: HR <60 bpm (concerning for AV block)
      
      Clinical Considerations:
      - Stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score)
      - Bleeding risk (HAS-BLED score)
      - Symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain)
      - Hemodynamic stability
      
      Management: Rate vs rhythm control, anticoagulation decisions.
    context: "AF management requires balancing stroke prevention with bleeding risk"
    parent: supraventricular_tachycardia_analysis
    clinical_significance: "AF is major cause of stroke requiring anticoagulation consideration"

  # Wide complex tachycardia differentiation
  - node_id: wide_complex_tachycardia_differentiation
    question: "Is wide complex tachycardia ventricular or supraventricular with aberrancy?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Wide Complex Tachycardia (WCT) Differentiation:
      
      Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Features:
      - AV dissociation (independent P-waves)
      - Capture beats (narrow QRS during WCT)
      - Fusion beats (hybrid narrow/wide morphology)
      - QRS >140ms
      - Concordance in precordial leads (all positive or negative)
      - Specific morphology criteria (Brugada, Vereckei algorithms)
      
      SVT with Aberrancy Features:
      - 1:1 VA relationship
      - QRS 120-140ms typically
      - Typical bundle branch block pattern
      - Response to vagal maneuvers or adenosine
      
      Clinical Context:
      - Age >35 years: VT more likely
      - Structural heart disease: VT more likely
      - Hemodynamic stability: Does not differentiate
      - Prior MI or cardiomyopathy: VT much more likely
      
      When in doubt, treat as VT (safer assumption).
      
      Brugada Criteria provide systematic approach to differentiation.
    context: "WCT differentiation determines treatment approach and long-term risk"
    parent: ventricular_arrhythmia_analysis
    clinical_significance: "Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment with serious consequences"

  # Emergency arrhythmia management
  - node_id: emergency_arrhythmia_management
    question: "What is the appropriate emergency management based on arrhythmia type and hemodynamic status?"
    knowledge_case: |
      Emergency Arrhythmia Management by Type:
      
      Immediate Life-Threatening (Unstable):
      - VF/Pulseless VT: Immediate defibrillation 200J biphasic
      - Polymorphic VT/Torsades: Defibrillation + magnesium 2g IV
      - Complete heart block with symptoms: Transcutaneous pacing
      - Any arrhythmia with hemodynamic compromise: Synchronized cardioversion
      
      Stable but Urgent:
      - Monomorphic VT: Amiodarone 150mg IV or cardioversion
      - SVT with RVR: Adenosine 6mg IV (if narrow), beta-blockers/CCB
      - New AF with RVR: Rate control vs cardioversion (timing dependent)
      - High-grade AV block: Atropine, transcutaneous pacing standby
      
      Hemodynamic Assessment:
      - Unstable: Hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, acute heart failure
      - Stable: Alert, adequate perfusion, tolerable symptoms
      
      Special Considerations:
      - WPW with AF: Avoid AV nodal blockers (procainamide preferred)
      - Torsades: Magnesium, correct QT interval, overdrive pacing
      - Digoxin toxicity: Digoxin-specific antibodies
      
      Always consider reversible causes: electrolytes, ischemia, drugs, hypoxia.
    context: "Emergency management prioritizes hemodynamic stability and prevention of deterioration"
    parent: wide_complex_tachycardia_differentiation
    clinical_significance: "Rapid recognition and treatment of unstable arrhythmias saves lives"
